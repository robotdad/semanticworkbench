# Podcast MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides podcast generation capabilities based on the existing Podcastly CLI application. The MCP server will expose the core functionality of Podcastly through MCP resources, tools, and prompts.

## Goals

1. Expose Podcastly's podcast generation capabilities through MCP
2. Allow users to upload documents and generate podcast scripts and audio
3. Support customization options including voices, styles, and podcast length
4. Provide a clean, well-structured API following MCP best practices

## Architecture

The implementation will follow these key architectural decisions:

1. Use the FastMCP framework from the MCP Python SDK
2. Leverage Podcastly's existing clean architecture
3. Adapt Podcastly's services to work in an MCP context
4. Maintain separation of concerns between different server components

## Core Components

### 1. MCP Server Components

- **Resources**: For accessing generated podcast scripts and audio files
- **Tools**: For uploading documents, generating podcasts, and customizing settings  
- **Prompts**: For guided podcast creation workflows

### 2. Adapted Podcastly Services

- Document processor for text extraction
- OpenAI agent for script generation
- Podcast composer for structuring content
- Audio generator for speech synthesis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Server Setup (1-2 days)

1. Set up server skeleton using FastMCP
2. Create directory structure for resources
3. Implement configuration handling
4. Add basic resource listing functionality

### Phase 2: Document Upload & Processing (2-3 days)

1. Implement document upload tool
2. Adapt the document processor service for MCP
3. Create temporary document storage mechanism
4. Add extraction result resource

### Phase 3: Podcast Generation (2-3 days)

1. Implement podcast generation tool
2. Adapt OpenAI agent and podcast composer services
3. Create podcast script resources
4. Add podcast generation status tracking

### Phase 4: Audio Generation (2-3 days)

1. Implement audio generation tool
2. Adapt audio generator service
3. Create audio file resources
4. Add voice and style customization options

### Phase 5: Prompts & Refinement (1-2 days)

1. Implement guided podcast creation prompts
2. Add voice selection prompt
3. Refine overall user experience
4. Optimize resource handling

## API Design

### Resources

1. `/podcast/{id}/script` - Access generated podcast scripts
2. `/podcast/{id}/audio` - Access generated podcast audio files
3. `/voices/list` - View available voices and styles

### Tools

1. `upload_document` - Upload document files for processing
2. `generate_podcast` - Generate podcast script from documents
3. `generate_audio` - Generate audio from podcast script
4. `list_voices` - List available voices and styles
5. `customize_voice` - Set voice and style preferences

### Prompts

1. `guided_podcast_creation` - Step-by-step workflow for creating podcasts
2. `voice_selection` - Help with selecting appropriate voices and styles

## Implementation Details

### Document Handling

- Documents will be uploaded to a temporary storage location
- Each document will be assigned a unique ID for tracking
- The Document Intelligence service will extract text using the same methods as Podcastly

### Podcast Generation

- The OpenAI agent will be adapted to handle asynchronous processing in an MCP context
- Podcast scripts will be stored in a resource accessible by URI
- Generation progress will be tracked and reported

### Audio Generation

- Audio files will be generated using the same Azure Speech Services integration
- Multiple voice options will be supported based on Podcastly's voice configuration
- Audio files will be stored as resources with appropriate MIME types

## Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Handling potentially large document and audio files in MCP
   **Mitigation**: Implement chunked transfer, progress reporting, and efficient resource handling

2. **Challenge**: Adapting the synchronous CLI workflow to asynchronous MCP patterns
   **Mitigation**: Redesign the workflow to properly use async/await patterns and MCP capabilities

3. **Challenge**: Managing Azure service authentication in MCP context
   **Mitigation**: Adapt the existing authentication mechanisms to work in the server environment

4. **Challenge**: Providing appropriate error handling and status updates
   **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages for clients

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for core service adaptations
2. Integration tests for MCP tools and resources
3. End-to-end tests for complete podcast generation workflows
4. Manual testing with Claude Desktop to validate user experience

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for batch processing multiple documents
2. Advanced customization of podcast format and style
3. Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. User settings persistence between sessions
5. Support for different document formats and sources

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Phases 1-2 (Core setup, Document handling)
- **Week 2**: Phases 3-4 (Podcast and Audio generation)
- **Week 3**: Phase 5 and testing (Prompts and refinement)

## Conclusion

The Podcast MCP Server will provide a powerful, flexible interface for generating podcasts from documents, leveraging the existing capabilities of Podcastly while adding the benefits of the Model Context Protocol. By following this implementation plan, we will create a server that provides a clean, consistent API for podcast generation that can be used by any MCP-capable client.
