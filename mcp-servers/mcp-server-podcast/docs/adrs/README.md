# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Podcast MCP Server project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences.

Each ADR describes:
- The architectural decision that was made
- The context and problem statement
- The decision drivers and constraints
- The considered options
- The resulting decision
- The consequences of that decision
